*This post originally appeared on my old blog. Copied over a slightly revised on 2014-07-10 (1405024000).*

I've just finished reading Dale Carnegie's classic *How to Win Friends and Influence People*. I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to reading it. Much of its content I have picked up through other sources, which I suspect speaks more to the usefulness of the ideas than the popularity of the book, but one thing it newly managed to convince me of is that people really like to be praised.

To me, this is somewhat strange. I find that my self-esteem is generated internally and only relies on other people insofar as they are either involved in the success or failure of things I want to feel esteemed for or they provide evidence that I have accomplished a thing I value. But in the spirit of [Scott Alexander's "What Universal Human Experiences Are You Missing Without Realizing It?"](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/17/what-universal-human-experiences-are-you-missing-without-realizing-it/), *How to Win Friends and Influence People* has done a good job of providing me with lots of evidence that, yes, other people actually care a great deal about what other people think intrinsically rather than instrumentally to achieving some other goal or satisfying some other value.

You may at this point be saying "duh, of course this is how people are", but it's very hard to figure this out when you don't experience something yourself. Much like a person might not realize they have dichromatic vision rather than the trichromatic vision most humans posses because they literally cannot see what they are missing, I have always just operated on the assumption that most people suffer some kind of difficulty in believing when they have satisfied their own values.

This is also probably also why the ideas of folks like [Alfie Kohn](http://www.alfiekohn.org/) have appealed to me. *Of course*, I'd think, the problem of giving direct praise is that it reinforces praise-seeking behavior rather than genuine achievement and leads to pathological praise-seeking that damages a person's ability to achieve their goals when no praise is offered. But no, it turns out, other people just like to be praised, and seeking praise is something that may motivate them to accomplish things. Receiving praise is valued for its own sake.

I still have a hard time imagining what it must be like to find value in receiving praise, but now I think I have a better grasp on why I may need to provide praise to other people even though I don't see it as valuable. For the real important lesson of *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, the one key idea you should take away from it, is that in all interactions between humans the best course of action, all else being equal, is the one that maximizes feelings among all parties of getting what they want.
