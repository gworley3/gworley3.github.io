Guilds (the kinds for craftsmen, not the kinds for Warrior Orc Princesses) had a three-level ranking of their members: apprentice, journeyman, and master. A person who wanted to learn a profession joined a guild as an apprentice. Apprentices started out doing simple tasks under the supervision of a master and moved on to more advanced work as their skills grew. Eventually an apprentice got good enough that they could become a journeyman by completing an independent project to show they could do high quality work on their own. A journeyman could then sell their labor. After more years of experience, a journeyman might choose to become a master by establishing their own shop (with the approval of the guild) and taking on apprentices.

Although we can hardly think of guilds as ideal organizations (there's a reason they don't exist anymore, or exist in much weaker form), there is some useful explanatory power in the apprentice/journeyman/master ranking system. My experience has been that many areas of specialization follow a common pattern that fits the three-level ranking, and I suspect it applies broadly to all specializations.

Let me give some examples. In my own profession, programming, the ranks are pretty clear to me. I even feel like there is a good way to describe what separates the apprentice from the journeyman from the master:

- The *apprentice* asks "how can I write code that solves this problem?"
- The *journeyman* asks "how will I write code that solves this problem?"
- The *master* asks "how should I write beautiful code that solves this problem?"

The apprentice is focused on figuring out the 'how' of programming. How do I get the computer to do what I want it to do? Is this even possible?

The journeyman knows what can and cannot be done with enough clarity that no problem feels impossible (except those that are impossible for any physical system), so they are focused on putting stuff together. They care most about the 'what' of programming: finding good solutions to problems with code.

The master can see endless different ways to solve a problem, so they care mainly about the 'why' of programming: how can I best solve this problem, taking into account many competing criteria simultaneously, including simplicity, correctness, maintainability, readability, and beauty.

In particular it seems to be this aesthetic sense that separates the journeymen from the masters. They journeyman is happy if the code works. The master is happy if the code works and is beautiful (and has the skills to make the code work and be beautiful).

Another place you can see these ranks are in games and sports. The apprentice mainly focuses on learning basic skills. The journeyman focuses on performing and winning. The master focuses on winning and making it look good. Compare also writing, teaching, acting, dancing, drawing, and of course any skilled profession.

Advancement from one rank to the next is not guaranteed. An apprentice will only become a journeyman if they hone their skills deliberately and achieve a deeper understanding of their specialization. And a journeyman will only become a master if they dedicate themselves to perfecting their skills and continuously improving and getting stronger.

There is no shame in staying at a lower rank. You have only limited time, and can probably only become a master in one or two domains. You may dabble at something and so always remain an apprentice, or be unable or uninterested in putting in the time and effort to become a master. The primary purpose of this ranking is to be descriptive, not to assign status.

But this gets to an interesting issue: what is the value in making these rankings more explicit? This kind of ranking seems to exist broadly, yet in most fields it is indirectly assigned via some other measure of achievement, if it is measured at all! This is to be expected, of course, since it's an assignment of status, and we humans mostly like our status [implicit and indirect](http://www.overcomingbias.com/tag/signaling). But is there any value in being more explicit about these ranks in particular fields, ignoring the status-style preference?

My suspicion is not. I think this kind of ranking introduces dangerous incentives that will cause people to focus more on their rank than on their development. They will focus on "how can I become a journeyman?" or "am I a master yet?" or even just "am I better than that other person?" rather than on how to become better. As I said earlier, this ranking is meant to be merely descriptive, not to assign status, but if it were to become more explicit then it would inevitably be used in such a way. Our specializations benefit from more, higher skilled participants by keeping the focus more on development and less on status, so it seems useful not to be too explicit about assessing people's ranks as it may distract from skill development.
