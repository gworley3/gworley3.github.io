i've decided to take my blog in a new direction. rather than just writing about a mix of stuff occasionally, i'm going to more regularly write about rationality related topics. most of these posts will be thoughts of various lengths that are not fully formed. some of the posts will be more traditional articles, though, with the intention that they receive wider audiences.

consequently i've also removed many old blog posts from the main page listing because they don't fit the new direction. they still exist and i didn't change their links, so they're still accessible if you have a link, but they no longer appear in the rss feed or on the home page. i may later list some of them somewhere. i also removed some old posts i consider low quality because i wrote them in the style of articles but they were only half-formed thoughts (hence the new thought/article distinction i'm making on this blog). that's why the blog now looks so bare, but i promise more content is coming as i rework some of the existing content and write new stuff.

in this vein, i now have a new url, [ineedtobecomestronger.com](http://ineedtobecomestronger.com). the site is not so secretly still hosted on github, but now is more linkable.

i look forward to exploring this new direction, and hope you stick around.
