*This is a post about [Less Wrong](http://www.lesswrong.com/) and rationality. It will almost certainly not make sense without context.*

I realized today that I have, for years, misremembered the translation of "[tsuyoku naritai](http://lesswrong.com/lw/h8/tsuyoku_naritai_i_want_to_become_stronger/)" as "I need to become stronger", but while looking for the Japanese characters for it I discovered that it translates as "I want to become stronger".

But “I want to become stronger” is missing something. It's not enough to work hard to become stronger, to desire to transcend your current abilities. Becoming stronger for its own sake serves no purpose. To be sure, you can continuously improve at something that will never serve a purpose other than fulfilling your own desire to become stronger.

Suppose you work very hard to get ever better at slurping noodles. You spend a lot of time thinking about how tightly the purse your lips, how hard to suck, and how many noodles to slurp at once. You eat nothing but noodles so you can practice and perfect your technique. You raise noodle slurping to an art form. And no matter how great you are at noodle slurping, you find you can always become a better noodle slurper in subtle ways that, even if only you can discern them, are worth pursuing.

But at the end of the day, you are still just getting calories into your body without making too much of a mess. Within a few hours of learning to slurp noodles you’ve already achieved nearly 100% of all there is to be gained from practicing noodle slurping. There is nothing more you can do that will continue to confer benefits that are worth the cost of developing them, for you or for anyone else.

Luckily, I seem to have conflated “tsuyoku naritai” with the [motif in Japanese fiction of characters gaining power because they need to protect something](http://lesswrong.com/lw/nb/something_to_protect/). But just like “tsuyoku naritai” is not enough on its own, neither is needing to protect something. Because in the real world, no matter how badly something needs protecting, no one, not even you, will suddenly find yourself up to the challenge. The only way to protect something is to become strong enough to protect it yourself. If not, no one else may rise to the challenge and your most precious thing will be lost because no one even really tried to save it.

And since neither was enough on its own, my brain seems to have put them together for me to get “I need to become stronger”. I work to become stronger, to transcend even myself when I become the greatest, because I need to in order to protect something.

And now that I realize this, I have a better formulation: “tueor ergo fortiorem me facio”. I protect something I care for, so I make myself stronger.

*Edited 2014-07-07 (1404763954) to change Latin phrase to "tueor facio fortior", which is more what I mean than the previous "protegam ergo fio fortior". Thanks to [Robby Bensinger](https://twitter.com/robbensinger) for the correction.*

*Edited 2014-07-07 (1404769552) Latin again to now read "tueor ergo fortiorem me facio" since I butchered Robby's advice. Thanks for setting me straight.*
