I'm done with my Blogger blog. Not with the content, mind you, just publishing on Blogger. The current site design is now very slow and, although it automatically works on mobile, it's still pretty inconvenient. From now on interesting this I write will appear here. I'll try to migrate some of the old posts and I think are interesting and worth keeping around at this new location.

This will also make it easier for me to publish posts with code in them. Doing that on Blogger was a pain.
