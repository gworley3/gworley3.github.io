I'm done with [my Blogger blog](http://gworley3.blogspot.com/). Not with the content, mind you, just publishing on Blogger. The current Blogger site design is slow and heavy weight, and it's not very good for writing about code (including Gists is about the only good way to get nicely formatted code, and even just including Gists is difficult), so I'm moving over here. I've been thinking about using GitHub pages for a while now, and the need to get new business cards (because after three years I'm finally almost out) gave me a good incentive to make the move now before I print up some cards with an old URL.

Unfortunately I have to fill in some of the details myself. As you can tell from the theme I'm going pretty minimalist.

Eventually I may move some old posts over here to keep them fresh, but most of what I wrote on Blogger is going to stay there. Blogs are mostly ephemeral writing, but on the Internet old links should live as long as possible, so hopefully those will stay up for a long time.  If you need one of those old articles, you can find them at:
