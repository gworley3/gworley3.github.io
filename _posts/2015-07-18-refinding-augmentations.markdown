beyond [techniques to better utilize memory](/wayfinding/refinding-optimizations.html), the skill of [refinding thought](/wayfinding/refinding-thoughts.html) can be improved with memory argumentation systems. they are not so complex as the name implies, though: simply put these are ways of storing thoughts outside your head so you can easily access them later. the complexity in memory augmentation lies in the vast web of technologies needed to make these systems practical. that's why even as recently as a few decades ago these sorts of systems were in less use than they are today, and will likely be in greater use in the future.

working memory is short, but the way it functions shows us how to improve upon it. working memory appears to be primarily an [auditory loop and visual sketchpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baddeley%27s_model_of_working_memory) of you repeating things to yourself. it's an internal mechanism for resending information as if you were sensing it for the first time. we can take advantage of the same technique, but using your eyes and putting the 'loop' outside your head.

you can augment your memory by making things visible (as in literally writing them down where you can see them). when you can quickly look around to see things you don't have to put any effort into remembering them other than recalling where to look when you need something. this is a far easier task than trying to keep lots of information in your head, because if nothing else you can quickly rescan everything in your visual field to find what you want.

but for this to work the information has to actually be visible to you. this works well if, for example, you work on a computer and have a large enough screen that you can multiplex it to see many views at once: web pages, documents you're editing, chat logs, whatever. or, if you're working on paper or with a chalk board, writing all the stuff you need to know where you can easily glance over to see it. all these work by taking the burden of remembering something in working memory and offloading it to a system so you don't have to keep it there, freeing up your working memory to have more space to work with new concepts as you think them up but haven't written them down.

if we take this same technique but make it about storing information and not looking at it right away, but rather having it available for later lookup, you get the great collection of memory augmentation systems we know as notes, diaries, papers, web pages, and books. we take these technologies for granted today (after all, this is literally the mechanism by which you are reading these words, albeit tuned for communication rather than just personal storage, but then what is personal storage except communication to yourself across time), let's look a bit at the trends in putting thoughts outside your head for long-term storage.

until the invention of the printing press people had to personally write down information they wanted to keep. at best they could hire a scribe to do it for them, but that was just labor displacement. afterwards it became possible for others to do the writing for you and all you had to do was buy a copy to look at when you needed the info. this gave an order of magnitude improvement in how much info could be stored and recalled.

the next major innovation came later, once enough writing existed that it could no longer be catalogued by a simple system. that innovation was indexing, i.e. methods for looking up books without knowing exactly what book you were looking for. indexing methods made it possible to grow human knowledge by another order of magnitude and to allow there to be more than any one person could know, thus leading to greater specialization in knowledge.

the next innovation came fairly recently: search. indexing requires coming up with a way to make information accessible in advance and anticipating how someone might want to look it up. search removes the need to make the decisions in advance and can let the person looking for the information decide how they want to find things. because making search work also requires automated indexing, it allows a double order of magnitude increase in what can be stored and considered.

it's unclear just what may be the next innovation to make information access easier, but we should expect it to have a similar dramatic multiply effect on how much information a single person can use.

so now that we've covered memory and [focus](/wayfinding/finding-focus.html), there remains one last part to your [natural wayfinding](/wayfinding/natural-wayfinding.html) abilities to be improved: prioritization. this is the last piece of the puzzle of how you can learn to [find your way](/wayfinding/finding-your-way.html).
