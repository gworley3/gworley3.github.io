*This is an updated version of an old post.*

One day I ran into someone who seemed surprised to meet another person who had read, understood, and deeply integrated into their life what they learned from Hofstadter's *Godel, Escher, and Bach*. I then shared with him my handful of books that were most influential to me. Since I think others might benefit from my short list, here it is, in the order I read them:

1. Holfstadter's *Godel, Escher, and Bach*. A foundation for thinking.
1. Symons's *The Evolution of Human Sexuality*. Some of the conclusions are wrong because of old, incorrect evidence, but the important thing is that it does a great job of explaining how evolution works.
1. Norman's *The Design of Everyday Things*. How to make and use things.
1. Schelling's *The Strategy of Conflict*. Explains how to apply game theory to real life.
1. Carnegie's *How to Win Friends and Influence People*. Lots of important advice for how to get what you want for yourself and others by applying human psychology.

As a bonus, I recommend reading [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com/), though that is not (yet) a book.
