*Back in 2010, I published on my old blog a series of posts describing my constructed language, kamuma sepeka. At the time my goal was just to scratch an itch to codify all the thinking I had been doing about my conlang. I now return to the topic in order to compose a single, complete introduction to the language. I've not done anything much of interest with kamuma sepeka in the last couple years, but I do have a couple ideas for projects I might one day like to work on that involve it, so I'd like to have a single document that describes the language. And since I find little motivation to write when I am my only audience, you, dear reader, are going to be subjected to this (mostly) repeat material.*

# Motivation

Kamuma sepeka is a constructed language with the express goal of being an auxiliary language that can be easily spoken by as many people as possible. The language contains only 9 phonemes, each one chosen to be easily distinguishable from the others and to have a readily available allophone in most natural languages. The grammar is based on the grammar of pidgins, which I believe represents the simplest essence of grammar that a language can sustain and still be useful. The writing system is similarly simple, built out of 9 radicals to represent each of the phonemes.

Below, I have left out nearly all details of my motivation for specific language features. If you are interested in these, I recommend [reading](http://gworley3.blogspot.com/2010/02/introduction-to-my-first-published.html) the [original](http://gworley3.blogspot.com/2010/03/grammar-and-syntax-of-kamuma-sepeka.html) [series](http://gworley3.blogspot.com/2010/03/building-kamuma-sepeka-vocabulary.html") of [blog](http://gworley3.blogspot.com/2010/03/more-kamuma-sepeka-grammar.html) [posts](http://gworley3.blogspot.com/2010/07/alphabet-for-kamuma-sepeka.html). The remainder of this post will primarily serve to describe the language's features.

# Phonetics

The sound system consists of 18 equal-length syllables, all of the form consonant-vowel (CV), built out of a set of 9 phonemes: three stop constants, three nonstop consonants, and three vowels.

The three vowels are the back, middle, and front vowel sounds, written as 'a', 'e', and 'u', respectively. Each of these vowel phonemes incorporates a lot of potential sounds, but the anchoring sounds are the vowel sounds in Arabic, \a\, \i\, and \u\. The vowels are named by what your mouth feels like it's doing when you produce the sounds: in \a\ your tongue is pulled back, in \i\ it's in the middle of your mouth, and in \u\ you resonate the sound in the front of the mouth.

The three stop constants also come in front, middle, and back varieties: 'p', 't', and 'k'. 'p' catches all the stop constants that are produced with the lips, 't' all the stop consonants produced with the flexible front part of the tongue, and 'k' all the stop consonants produced with the back of the tongue. Think English vowel groups b, p; d, t; and g, k.

The three nonstop consonants come in front, middle, and back forms, which are 'm', 's', and 'r'. 'm' is a humming sound you make with your lips, 's' is a hissing sound you make with your tongue or teeth, and 'r' can be any of the non-stop sounds you make with the back of your throat, such as the growling 'r' in English or the non-stop 'h' or 'wh' sounds.

Thus we have our phonemes (p, t, k, m, s, r, a, e, u) and syllabary of 18 equal length CV syllables: pa, pe, pu, ta, te, tu, ka, ke, ku, ma, me, mu, sa, se, su, ra, re, ru.

Note that, as described below, the word space in kamuma sepeka is dense, so spoken words must be said with some end of word indicator since the words themselves lack normal end-of-word marking patterns. Several options are available. I speak kamuma sepeka with a rising tone on the final syllable of each word (like an exaggerated Scandinavian accent), but other options include other tone changes, vowel lengthening, or an end of word marker sound (e.g. using a nasal like English 'n', the language would be spoken like 'kamuman sepekan').

# Vocabulary

Because of the limited phonology, kamuma sepeka's word space is dense in that nearly all possible words (that is, all possible combinations of syllables into single words) have meaning. This is necessary to keep words short. To promote efficiency, all 18 of the one syllable words are used either for very basic concepts or functional words (and are described in the next section). By simple mathematics, we see there are 324 two syllable words, 5832 three syllable words, and 104,976 four syllable words. Thus most regularly used words can fit within the space of approximately 110,000 short words, and more rarely used words can spill to five syllables to grab an additional 1.8 million possible words, well more than enough for even all the words in the English language when you include jargon.

As much as possible, homonyms are to be avoided.

I have created a few nongrammatically necessary words, with some listed below so I can use them later in examples:

- kamuma - common/shared
- sepeka - speaking
- rape - happiness
- puta - beautifulness
- repa - book
- senuse - science
- rusa - redness
- pene - pen

# Grammar and Syntax

As much as possible, kamuma sepeka is an analytic, isolating language. Word order is strict: all sentences are of the form subject-verb-object (SVO).

Strictly speaking, kamuma sepeka is a language made primarily of nouns with only three properly recognized verbs. The first verb, 'se', is the verb of being and state, similar to English 'to be'. The second verb, 'sa', is the verb of having and possession. And the third verb is 'ku', which expresses action. Complex actions and relationships are described by combining one of the verbs with one or more nouns to form a verb phrase.

By way of example, consider the word 'puta', which means beauty. Saying 'se puta' expresses beauty as something fundamental to the subject. Saying 'sa puta' expresses beauty as something belonging to the subject. And saying 'ku puta' expresses the act of making something beautiful.

Since kamuma sepeka is analytic, there are no verb conjugations to express tense, mood, case, aspects, etc.. Instead, verbs are modified either by adding information to sentences or by using grammatical particles.

To negate a verb (or anything else), the word is 'pu'. This is also the word for no. For example, 'se pu puta' means something is not beautiful.

To form a question, begin the sentence/phrase with the word 'ma'.

To express that something happened in the past or will happen in the future, 'ka' is the word for past or before and 'pa' is the word for future or after. For example, if something was beautiful in the past the verb phrase becomes 'se ka puta'.

Conditional statements are marked using 'ra' (i.e. English 'if'), to say things like 'I am happy if I get my way' by appending a condition to a statement.

There are three pronouns in kamuma sepeka: one each for the first, second, and third person. The first person pronoun is 'me', the second person pronoun is 'ta', and the third person pronoun (also used for things) is 're'. To form the plural forms of the pronouns, or any noun in kamuma sepeka, the word 'su' is prepended, which translates as 'more than one'. So 'su me' is 'us', 'su ta' is 'you all', and 'su re' is 'them'.

The word 'mu' expresses possession. For example, we might say 'my book' as 'repa mu me'. When the possessor is not a person or something else that is clearly able to own things, though, an alternative form is permitted. The order is reversed and the pronoun is dropped, so to say 'science book' we could say 'repa mu senuse' or 'senuse repa'. This can be done whenever the meaning is clear, and is especially encouraged for common terms, since this is essentially how most complex concepts are expressed in kamuma sepeka: by putting together simpler words to form what can be thought of as compound words.

The only demonstrative in kamuma sepeka is 'te', like English this. Since there are no articles in kamuma sepeka, 'te', in addition to its use as the demonstrative, is also used to serve the role of definite article when needed. If there is a particular book you want to talk about, you would refer to it as 'te repa', but otherwise you just use 'repa' on it's own.

The word for 'yes' in kamuma sepeka is 'ru'. It can also be used as an intensifier, as in 'te repa ru ku rape me', 'the book really makes me happy'.

The words 'tu' and 'pe' work together as a pair to surround subordinate clauses. Think of 'tu' as an opening parenthesis and 'pe' as a closing one. When you want to add a subordinate clause or phrase, start it with 'tu' and end it with 'pe'. So to say something like 'The boy, who is over there, reads to me', you would say 'te puru tu ta se ke te sara parase pe ku rete ke me', which transliterates roughly as 'this boy (he is at this far place) reads to me'.

Kamuma sepeka contains only three kinds of words: the three vowels, the several function words described above, and nouns. The work done by other parts of speech in other languages are instead done by using nouns and juxtaposition or function words.

For example, an adverb is a noun that falls after the verb (but before the action noun, if there is one) and an adjective is adjacent to a noun. There is no need to use 'mu' with adjectives unless the meaning might not be clear: 'red pen' and 'pen of red' are both acceptable ways to express the same idea (in kamuma sepeka, 'rusa pene' and 'pene mu rusa'), so the form used will depend simply on making sure the meaning is clear. The same applies for adverbs: 'mu' can be used if needed, but it is not necessary.

# Writing System

Kamuma sepeka, when not written as I have here in its romanized form, is written using the kamuma sepeka rapapeta ('rapapeta' being the word for a writing system). Much in the way the Korean alphabet builds symbols representing syllables out of smaller, alphabetic components, the kamuma sepeka rapapeta does the same thing. Each syllabic symbol consists of a vowel radical and a consonant radical. Since all syllables are CV, we need only combine the radicals in some way to form syllable symbols.

The chart on the left in the image below describes the kamuma sepeka rapapeta with vowel radicals along the top (and their romanized equivalents along the bottom) and the consonant radicals along the left (and their romanized equivalents along the right) and the syllable symbols at their intersections.

The table on the right is a sample of what handwritten kamuma sepeka rapapeta might look like, with symbols arranged in the same way as in the table to the left, and reflects the simplification that handwriting brings.

# Future Developments

Kamuma sepeka is still missing a good list of vocabulary and a description of the culture surrounding the language. The language would also benefit from a greater list of examples. As time permits, I intend to go beyond this introduction and flesh out those features.
